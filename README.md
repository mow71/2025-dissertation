# Enterprise Reference Architecture for Demand-Responsive Public Transport

## Overview

This repository contains research artifacts, models, and documentation developed in the context of the doctoral dissertation:

**"Integration von bedarfsorientiertem Verkehr in klassische ÖPNV-Unternehmen – Entwurf eines Enterprise Referenz-Architekturmodells"**

The work focuses on the integration of demand-responsive New Mobility Services (NMS) into the enterprise architectures (EA) of traditional, supply-oriented public transport (ÖPNV) companies. A central contribution is the design, evaluation, and presentation of a reference enterprise architecture (REA), developed following the Design Science Research (DSR) paradigm.

## Research Context

With the rising popularity of New Mobility Services — such as car sharing, bike rentals, and on-demand ride pooling — public transport providers face increasing pressure to adapt their IT systems and service architectures. This project proposes a structured reference model that extends existing EA frameworks (e.g., ITVU) to facilitate the integration of NMS into public transport enterprises.

## Repository Structure




## Methodology

This research adopts the Design Science Research (DSR) framework, following its six core activities:

1. **Problem Identification and Motivation**
2. **Definition of the Objectives for a Solution**
3. **Design and Development** of the REA
4. **Demonstration** of the EA using real-world use cases (e.g., BerlKönig)
5. **Evaluation** through expert feedback and case-based validation
6. **Communication** through academic publications and presentations

## Key Contributions

- A domain-specific REA for public transport enterprises integrating NMS
- Extension of the ITVU core model with strategic, business, and application architecture layers
- Evaluation through case studies and expert reviews in cooperation with public transport operators
- Structured guidelines and capability maps for aligning IT and mobility strategy
